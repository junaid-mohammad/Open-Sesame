# Secrets Login App

This repository contains the source code for **Secrets**, a simple login app where users can input a password to access hidden secrets. The project is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and custom middleware to handle password validation.

## Live Website

The live version of the Secrets app will be accessible here: [Secrets App](#)

Stay tuned for the link once it is deployed!

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn and practice the fundamentals of **Node.js**, **Express**, and custom middleware functions. By building this mini login app, I aimed to solidify my understanding of backend routing, request handling, and how to implement middleware for input validation. It also introduced me to creating simple and responsive UI elements.

## Features

- **Login Page**: A secure form where users can input a password to access hidden secrets.
- **Custom Middleware**: Password validation implemented through a custom middleware function in Express.
- **Access Control**: Based on the password entered, users are either granted access to a secrets page or redirected to an error page.
- **Error Page**: Provides feedback for incorrect password entries and allows users to retry.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts for desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for server-side JavaScript.
- **Express**: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming form data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to create and style the front-end pages.

## What I Learned

- Gained a deeper understanding of **Express routing** and middleware in Node.js.
- Practiced creating **custom middleware** functions to validate user input.
- Enhanced skills in **handling HTTP requests** and responses.
- Improved my ability to create **responsive and user-friendly UIs** using HTML and CSS.
- Learned to manage **file structures** for organizing public assets in web applications.
