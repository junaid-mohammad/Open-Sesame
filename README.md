## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my knowledge of **Node.js**, **Express**, **middleware**, as well as hosting the app using **Microsoft Azure** through a practical, hands-on project. I aimed to:

- Create a backend server using Node.js and Express.
- Implement custom middleware to validate user input.
- Practice managing request/response cycles and serving static files.
- Gain experience deploying web apps on **Microsoft Azure**.

Additionally, this project provided an opportunity to practice creating user-friendly interfaces with **HTML** and **CSS**.

## üöÄ Deployment on Azure

The Secrets Login App is deployed on **Microsoft Azure** using **App Service**. Below is a summary of the steps taken to deploy the project:

1. **Created an Azure Organization**: Set up a project in **Azure DevOps**.
2. **Pushed the Code to Azure Repos**: Used the following commands to add Azure as a remote repository and push the code:
   ```bash
   git remote add azure https://Junaid-Arif@dev.azure.com/Junaid-Arif/Secrets%20Express%20Project/_git/Secrets%20Express%20Project
   git push azure --all
   ```
3. **Configured App Service**:
   - Created a new **App Service** in Azure.
   - Linked the Azure Repo to the App Service for continuous deployment.
4. **Set Environment Variables**: Configured the app to use the correct port with:
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```
5. **Restarted the Service**: Restarted the Azure App Service to finalize the deployment.
